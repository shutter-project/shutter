      Shutter is a feature-rich screenshot program. You can take a screenshot of a
      specific area, window, your whole screen, or even of a website - apply different
      effects to it, draw on it to highlight points, and then upload to an image
      hosting site, all within one window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shutter allows you to capture nearly anything on your screen without losing
      control over your screenshots (tabbed interface).
      You don't need to open an external graphics editor like GIMP, because Shutter
      ships with its own built-in editor.
